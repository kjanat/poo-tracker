# Poo Tracker Backend

A comprehensive health tracking application backend built in Go, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clean architecture patterns.

## Project Overview

The Poo Tracker backend provides a REST API for comprehensive digestive health monitoring, including bowel movement tracking, meal logging, symptom monitoring, medication management, and advanced health analytics.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- Trend analysis and pattern recognition
- Personalized health scoring (0-100)
- Evidence-based recommendations
- Risk factor identification

**Service Operations**:

- `GetUserHealthOverview()`: Comprehensive health summary
- `GetCorrelationAnalysis()`: Factor relationship analysis
- `GetTrendAnalysis()`: Time-series health trends
- `GetBehaviorPatterns()`: Behavioral pattern recognition
- `GetHealthInsights()`: Actionable health insights
- `GetHealthScore()`: Overall health scoring
- `GetRecommendations()`: Personalized recommendations

## Development

```bash
# Run the server
go run ./cmd/server/main.go

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build for production
go build -o bin/server ./cmd/server/main.go
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start development server
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### Architecture

- `internal/model` ‚Äì domain models
- `internal/repository` ‚Äì repository interfaces and implementations
- `internal/service` ‚Äì business logic with pluggable analytics strategies
- `server` ‚Äì HTTP handlers and routing

The `main.go` file wires dependencies using constructor functions. A memory repository is used by default but can be swapped out for a real database implementation.

### Endpoints

- `GET /health` ‚Äì basic health check
- `GET /api/bowel-movements` ‚Äì list entries
- `POST /api/bowel-movements` ‚Äì create entry
  - Request body: `{"userId": "string", "bristolType": 1-7, "notes": "optional"}`
- `GET /api/bowel-movements/:id` ‚Äì get entry
- `PUT /api/bowel-movements/:id` ‚Äì update entry
  - Request body: `{"bristolType": 1-7, "notes": "optional"}` (partial updates supported)
- `DELETE /api/bowel-movements/:id` ‚Äì delete entry
- `GET /api/meals` ‚Äì list meals
- `POST /api/meals` ‚Äì create meal
  - Request body: `{"userId": "string", "name": "string", "calories": number}`
- `GET /api/meals/:id` ‚Äì get meal
- `PUT /api/meals/:id` ‚Äì update meal
  - Request body: `{"name": "string", "calories": number}` (partial updates supported)
