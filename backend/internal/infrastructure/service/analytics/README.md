## Component Overview

### AnalyticsService (`analytics_service.go`)

**Purpose**: Main orchestrator that implements the domain Service interface
**Responsibilities**:

- Coordinates data retrieval from multiple repositories
- Delegates specialized analysis to subcomponents
- Converts between infrastructure and domain models
- Manages configuration and error handling

**Key Methods**:

- `GetUserHealthOverview()`: Aggregates data and generates comprehensive health summary

## Data Flow

```
1. API Request → AnalyticsService
2. AnalyticsService → Domain Repositories (fetch raw data)
3. AnalyticsService → DataAggregator (aggregate data)
4. AnalyticsService → Specialized Analyzers (perform analysis)
5. Analyzers → Calculators (compute metrics)
6. AnalyticsService → InsightEngine (generate insights)
7. AnalyticsService → Domain Models (convert results)
8. Domain Models → API Response
```

## Configuration

### AnalyticsServiceConfig

```go
type AnalyticsServiceConfig struct {
    DefaultMedicationLimit int           // Max medications to analyze
    DefaultDataWindow      time.Duration // Default analysis window
    // Additional configuration options...
}
```

## Error Handling

Each component follows the domain error model:

- Uses domain-specific errors from `analytics.errors`
- Wraps infrastructure errors with context
- Provides detailed error messages for debugging
- Maintains error chain for traceability

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- Aggregated data cached for repeated analysis
- Health scores cached with TTL
- Pattern analysis results cached by date range

### Database Optimization

- Efficient date range queries
- Proper indexing on user_id and recorded_at
- Pagination for large datasets
- Connection pooling for concurrent analysis

### Memory Management

- Streaming data processing for large datasets
- Garbage collection friendly data structures
- Memory pooling for frequent allocations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Each component has comprehensive unit tests
- Mock repositories for isolated testing
- Test data generators for consistent test scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Real database integration tests
- Performance benchmarking tests

### Test Data

- Synthetic health data generators
- Edge case scenario testing
- Load testing with realistic data volumes

## Monitoring and Observability
