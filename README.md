# Poo Tracker

Ever wondered if your gut’s on a winning streak, or if your last kebab is about to take its revenge? Welcome to **Poo Tracker**, the brutally honest app that lets you log every majestic turd, rabbit pellet, and volcanic diarrhea eruption without shame or censorship. Because your bowel movements _do_ matter, and no, your GP isn’t getting this level of data.

## What’s the fucking point?

- **Track your shits**: Log every glorious bowel movement in a timeline worthy of its own Netflix docu-series. Date, time, volume, Bristol score, color, floaters—you name it.
- **Photo evidence**: Snap a pic for science (or just to traumatize your friends and family, your call). Upload and catalog the full visual glory of your rectal output.
- **Meal log**: Record what you’ve stuffed down your throat so you can finally prove that Taco Tuesday was, in fact, a war crime against your colon.
- **AI-powered analysis**: Our cold, heartless machine learning model doesn’t judge—just coldly correlates your food, stress, and fiber intake with your latest gut grenade. Get insights about patterns, triggers, and maybe even a round of applause for that legendary monster log you laid last Friday.
- **Export & share**: PDF reports for your doctor, gastroenterologist, or weird fetish community. It’s your data, so overshare as you wish.

## How it works

1. **Eat** something questionable.
2. **Shit**. (Preferably in a toilet, but we’re not here to kink-shame.)
3. **Log** your experience in Poo Tracker—optionally add a photo, rate your suffering, describe the smell if you’re brave enough.
4. **Repeat** until you finally realize you’re lactose intolerant or have IBS.

## Privacy, baby

We encrypt your brown notes and hide them away. Nobody’s reading your logs except you—and whatever godforsaken AI wants to learn about the day-after effects of your sushi buffet.

## Who is this for?

- People with IBS, Crohn, colitis, or “nobody shits like me” syndrome.
- Control freaks and data lovers.
- Curious bastards who just want to know if spicy food really _is_ their nemesis.
