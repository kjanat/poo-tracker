# üí© Poo Tracker

Ever wondered if your gut's on a winning streak, or if your last kebab is about to take its revenge? Welcome to **Poo Tracker**, the brutally honest app that lets you log every majestic turd, rabbit pellet, and volcanic diarrhea eruption without shame or censorship. Because your bowel movements _do_ matter, and no, your GP isn't getting this level of data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- pnpm (because npm is for amateurs)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kjanat/poo-tracker.git
   cd poo-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start the services:**

   ```bash
   # Start database and supporting services
   pnpm run docker:up

   # Start the development servers
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   pnpm run db:migrate

   # (Optional) Seed with test data
   pnpm run db:seed
   ```

6. **Open your browser:**

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend API: <http://localhost:3002>
- AI Service: <http://localhost:8001>
- MinIO Console: <http://localhost:9002> (minioadmin/minioadmin123)

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible for photos)
- **AI Service**: Python + FastAPI + scikit-learn
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Docker Compose

## üìñ What's the fucking point?

- **Track your shits**: Log every glorious bowel movement in a timeline worthy of its own Netflix docu-series. Date, time, volume, Bristol score, color, floaters‚Äîyou name it.
- **Photo evidence**: Snap a pic for science (or just to traumatize your friends and family). Upload and catalog the full visual glory of your rectal output.
- **Meal log**: Record what you've stuffed down your throat so you can finally prove that Taco Tuesday was, in fact, a war crime against your colon.
- **AI-powered analysis**: Our cold, heartless machine learning model doesn't judge‚Äîjust coldly correlates your food, stress, and fiber intake with your latest gut grenade.
- **Export & share**: PDF reports for your doctor, gastroenterologist, or weird fetish community. It's your data, so overshare as you wish.

## üìù How it works

1. **Eat** something questionable.
2. **Shit**. (Preferably in a toilet, but we're not here to kink-shame.)
3. **Log** your experience in Poo Tracker‚Äîoptionally add a photo, rate your suffering, describe the smell if you're brave enough.
4. **Repeat** until you finally realize you're lactose intolerant or have IBS.
