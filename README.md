# üí© Poo Tracker

<img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="branding/logo.svg">

Ever wondered if your gut's on a winning streak, or if your last kebab is about to take its revenge? Welcome to **Poo Tracker**, the brutally honest app that lets you log every majestic turd, rabbit pellet, and volcanic diarrhea eruption without shame or censorship. Because your bowel movements _do_ matter, and no, your GP isn't getting this level of data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.22+ (backend, uses Gin + GORM)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ (frontend only)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+ (because npm is for amateurs)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python (because pip is for the weak)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kjanat/poo-tracker.git
   cd poo-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Install Node.js dependencies (frontend only)
   cd frontend && pnpm install

   # Install Python dependencies for AI service
   cd ai-service && uv sync && cd ..
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   cp ai-service/.env.example ai-service/.env
   # Edit each file with your local values
   ```

4. **Start the services:**

   ```bash
   # Start database and supporting services
   make docker-up

   # Start all development servers (frontend + Go backend + AI)
   make dev
   ```

5. **Set up the database:**

   Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   make docker-up
   ```

   A sample set of credentials for API testing is provided in
   [`login.example.json`](login.example.json). Copy this file to
   `login.json` if you need a local login file that's ignored by Git.

6. **Open your browser:**

- Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
- Backend API: <http://localhost:3002>
- AI Service: <http://localhost:8001>
- MinIO Console: <http://localhost:9002> (minioadmin/minioadmin123)

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS v4
- **Backend**: Go + Gin + GORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for dev)
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible for photos)
- **AI Service**: Python + FastAPI + scikit-learn
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Package Management**: pnpm (Node.js) + uv (Python)

## üìù Environment Variables

Each package ships with an `.env.example` file. Copy them and tweak the values before running anything:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
cp ai-service/.env.example ai-service/.env
```

These example files contain **sample credentials only**. Replace them with your real secrets and **never commit private keys or passwords** to the repository.

## üìñ What's the fucking point?

- **Track your shits**: Log every glorious bowel movement in a timeline worthy of its own Netflix docu-series. Date, time, volume, Bristol score, color, floaters‚Äîyou name it.
- **Photo evidence**: Snap a pic for science (or just to traumatize your friends and family). Upload and catalog the full visual glory of your rectal output.
- **Meal log**: Record what you've stuffed down your throat so you can finally prove that Taco Tuesday was, in fact, a war crime against your colon.
- **AI-powered analysis**: Our cold, heartless machine learning model doesn't judge‚Äîjust coldly correlates your food, stress, and fiber intake with your latest gut grenade.
- **Export & share**: PDF reports for your doctor, gastroenterologist, or weird fetish community. It's your data, so overshare as you wish.

## üîß Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development - All Services
make dev              # Start frontend, Go backend and AI service
make dev-frontend     # Start frontend only
make dev-backend      # Start Go backend only
make dev-ai           # Start AI service only

# Building
make build            # Build all projects
make build-frontend   # Build frontend only
make build-backend    # Build Go backend only

# Database Operations
# (Database migrations handled automatically by GORM in Go backend)

# Testing & Quality
make test             # Run all tests (frontend + backend)
make test-frontend    # Run frontend tests only
make test-backend     # Run backend tests only
make lint             # Run linters on all projects
make lint-fix         # Auto-fix linting issues
make clean            # Clean all build artifacts

# Code Formatting
make format           # Format backend and AI service

# For watch mode in frontend tests, use:
#   make test-frontend WATCH=1
# (or add a Makefile target if needed)
```

> **Note:** Always use Makefile targets for all workflows (test, lint, build, dev). Do not use pnpm workspace commands directly.

### Workspace Management

This project uses **pnpm workspaces** for efficient monorepo management:

```bash
# Install dependencies for specific workspace
cd frontend && pnpm add react-router-dom

# Run commands on specific workspaces
cd frontend && pnpm run build

# Run commands on all workspaces
pnpm --recursive run build
pnpm --parallel run dev
```

## üìù How it works

1. **Eat** something questionable.
2. **Shit**. (Preferably in a toilet, but we're not here to kink-shame.)
3. **Log** your experience in Poo Tracker‚Äîoptionally add a photo, rate your suffering, describe the smell if you're brave enough.
4. **Repeat** until you finally realize you're lactose intolerant or have IBS.

## üîí Privacy, baby

We encrypt your brown notes and hide them away. Nobody's reading your logs except you‚Äîand whatever godforsaken AI wants to learn about the day-after effects of your sushi buffet.

## üë• Who is this for?

- People with IBS, Crohn, colitis, or "nobody shits like me" syndrome.
- Control freaks and data lovers.
- Curious bastards who just want to know if spicy food really _is_ their nemesis.
