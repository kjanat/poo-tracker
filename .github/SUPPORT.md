## 🚀 Self-Help Resources

### Common Issues

#### Setup Problems

**Docker not starting:**

```bash
# Check Docker status
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# Reset Docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**Dependencies not installing:**

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
cd frontend && pnpm install
```

**Database connection issues:**

```bash
# Check database is running
docker-compose ps

# Backend written in Go - reset via SQL scripts if needed
```

#### Development Issues

**TypeScript errors:**

- Check your `tsconfig.json` configuration
- Make sure all dependencies are installed
- Restart your IDE's TypeScript service

**Go backend errors:**

- Ensure Go is installed and in your PATH
- Check that the database is running and accessible
- Look for error messages in the backend logs

**Build failures:**

- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Try clearing build cache

- **Test failures:**

- Run tests in isolation: `cd frontend && pnpm run test -- --run`
- Check test database configuration
- Make sure test data is properly cleaned up

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check the logs:**

   ```bash
   # Docker container logs
   docker-compose logs frontend
   docker-compose logs backend
   docker-compose logs ai-service
   ```

2. **Use the debugger:**

   - Frontend: Browser dev tools
   - Backend: VS Code debugger or `console.log`
   - AI Service: Python debugger or print statements

3. **Isolate the problem:**
   - Test individual components
   - Use minimal reproduction cases
   - Check network requests in dev tools

## 🛠️ Running Tests and Linting

- Always use Makefile targets for testing, linting, and building:
  - `make test-frontend` for frontend tests
  - `make test-backend` for backend tests
  - `make test` for all tests
  - `make lint` for linting all services
  - `make build` for building all services
- Do not use pnpm workspace commands directly for these tasks.
