# Replace Stub Analytics Implementations

Several helper methods in `analytics_service.go` are marked as stubs.
These should be replaced with fully featured analytics logic or delegated to dedicated components.

- Identify existing stub functions.
- Implement real analysis algorithms or move the logic to analyzers.
- Ensure adequate unit tests cover the new implementations.
